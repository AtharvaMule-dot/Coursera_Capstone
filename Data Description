II. Description of the data:
The main data used for this project will be from two sources:

The average price by neighborhoods in New York city. (CityRealty)
The venues in each neighborhood. (FourSquare API)
Other supporting data:

Coordinates (Geocoder Python)
GeoJson (http://data.beta.nyc)
*Note: This project will only consider the average price of 2-bedrooms condo, which is a common type of real estate among normal families.

1. Data collection process:
The average price will be scrapped from the CityRealty website.
For each neighborhood, call Geocoder Python to get its coordinate.
For each neighborhood's coordinate, call FourSquare API to get the surrounding venues.
Count the occurrences of each venue type and attach that information to each neighborhood.
The output of the data collecting process will be a 2 dimensions dataframe:

Each row represents a neighborhood.
Each column will be the count of one type of venue in that neighborhood.
The last column will be the average 2-bedroom condo price of that neighborhood.
2. Using data to solve the question:
First, correlation between price and surrounding venues will be checked.
Second, if correlated, machine learning techniques (PCA, Regression, PCR) will be used to analyze the data. The output will be a list of venues types that effect the most on price, along with their weight on the result.
